 In this Repository, I will be working with the MovieTweetings data to apply each of the three methods of recommendations:
 ***
    1. Knowledge Based Recommendations 
    2. Collaborative Filtering Based Recommendations 
    3. Content Based Recommendations

## 1. Knowledge Based Recommendations

Knowledge based recommendations frequently are implemented using filters, and are extremely common amongst luxury based goods. Filters that you might see when purchasing items like cars or homes are examples of knowledge based recommendations. In knowledge based recommendations, users provide information about the types of recommendations they would like back.

 Take a look at the filters available on Zillow in the image below. This is an example of building in a knowledge based recommendation, as users can add their own preferences to the items that are provided.
